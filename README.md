## Personal vim configuration

This is my vim config. I made it from several plugins all available on GitHub.  
This is not something I coded myself, I simply did put together free / open source  
plugins around vim for a convenient config.   
All thanks and respect to the authors of the code used here.  
I store it here so I can 'git clone' it from anywhere.  
Feel free to do so and adapt it to your needs !  
  
To clone and use this config, type :  

```
mkdir ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
git clone git@github.com:gdelanoy/vim.git .
cd
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc .vimrc
```
  
  


### Enjoy ;-)
